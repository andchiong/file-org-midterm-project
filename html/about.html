    <h4>
        <p>Hello Dear Reader! My name is Anne Danielle Chiong. I am currently 22 years old and a student in Information Technology. I will tell you about myself in this autobiography.</p>
        <p>I was born on April 30, 2001 in Cebu City, Cebu to Danny R. Chiong and Annette L. Chiong. I have an older brother named Dominic Andre L. Chiong. I grew up in Dipolog City, where I currently live until today.</p>
        <p>I started school in Dipolog Community School, where I studied until Grade 3. I transferred to Globl Springs of Learning Academy, where I graduated in elementary school and high school. During senior high, I first studied in Philippine Christian Gospel School in Cebu City, and then transferred to M. Zed Christian School, where I graduated from senior high school. Today I study at the Centre for International Education, where I am learning Information Technology.</p>
        <p>My hobbies are playing the piano and violin, drawing, listening to music, writing, reading, and Muay Thai. I also like to learn new things and research for new, truthful information.</p>
